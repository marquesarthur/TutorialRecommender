   <p> Smack is a library for communicating with XMPP servers to perform real-time communications, including instant messaging and group chat.</p>

   <p class="subheader"> Smack Key Advantages </p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Extremely simple to use, yet powerful API. Sending a text message to a user can be accomplished in only a few lines of code: 
     <div class="code"> 
      <pre>
Connection connection = <font color="navy"><b>new</b></font> XMPPConnection(<font color="green">&quot;jabber.org&quot;</font>);
connection.connect();
connection.login(<font color="green">&quot;mtucker&quot;</font>, <font color="green">&quot;password&quot;</font>);
Chat chat = connection.getChatManager().createChat(<font color="green">&quot;jsmith@jivesoftware.com&quot;</font>, new MessageListener() {
public void processMessage(Chat chat, Message message) {
System.out.println(<font color="green">&quot;Received message: &quot;</font> + message);
}
});
chat.sendMessage(<font color="green">&quot;Howdy!&quot;</font>);
</pre> 
     </div> </li> 
    <li>Doesn't force you to code at the packet level, as other libraries do. Smack provides intelligent higher level constructs such as the <tt>
      <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.Chat" api="Chat" kind="class">
       Chat
      </clt></tt> and <tt> 
      <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.Roster" api="Roster" kind="class">
        Roster 
      </clt></tt> classes, which let you program more efficiently. </li> 
    <li>Does not require that you're familiar with the XMPP XML format, or even that you're familiar with XML. </li> 
    <li>Provides easy machine to machine communication. Smack lets you set any number of properties on each message, including properties that are Java objects. </li> 
    <li>Open Source under the Apache License, which means you can incorporate Smack into your commercial or non-commercial applications. </li> 
   </ul>

   <p class="subheader"> How To Use This Documentation </p> This documentation assumes that you're already familiar with the main features of XMPP instant messaging. It's also highly recommended that you open the Javadoc API guide and use that as a reference while reading through this documentation.

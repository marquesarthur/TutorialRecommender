   <p> This document will introduce you to the Smack API and provide an overview of important classes and concepts. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="subsection"> 
   <p class="subheader"> JAR Files and Requirements </p> Smack is meant to be easily embedded into any existing JDK 1.5 or later Java application. It has no external dependencies (except for the Jingle voice chat functionality) and is optimized to be as small as possible. The library ships as several JAR files to provide more flexibility over which features applications require: 
   <ul> 
    <li><tt>smack.jar</tt> -- provides core XMPP functionality and is the only <b>required</b> library. All XMPP features that are part of the XMPP RFCs are included.</li> 
    <li><tt>smackx.jar</tt> -- support for many of the the extensions (XEPs) defined by the XMPP Standards Foundation, including multi-user chat, file transfer, user search, etc. The extensions are documented in the <a href="extensions/index.html">extensions manual</a>.</li> 
    <li><tt>smackx-debug.jar</tt> -- an enhanced GUI debugger for protocol traffic. It will automatically be used when found in the classpath and when <a href="debugging.html">debugging</a> is enabled.</li> 
   </ul> 
  </div> 
  <div class="subsection"> 
   <p class="subheader">Establishing a Connection</p> The 
   <tt> 
    <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.XMPPConnection" api="XMPPConnection" kind="class">
      XMPPConnection 
    </clt></tt> class is used to create a connection to an XMPP server. Below are code examples for making a connection: 
   <p> </p> 
   <div class="code"> 
    <pre>
<font color="gray"><i>// Create a connection to the jabber.org server.</i></font>
Connection conn1 = <font color="navy"><b>new</b></font> XMPPConnection(<font color="green">&quot;jabber.org&quot;</font>);
conn1.connect();
<font color="gray"><i>// Create a connection to the jabber.org server on a specific port.</i></font>
ConnectionConfiguration config = new ConnectionConfiguration(<font color="green">&quot;jabber.org&quot;</font>, 5222);
Connection conn2 = <font color="navy"><b>new</b></font> XMPPConnection(config);
conn2.connect();
</pre> 
   </div> 
   <p>Note that maximum security will be used when connecting to the server by default (and when possible), including use of TLS encryption. The ConnectionConfiguration class provides advanced control over the connection created, such as the ability to disable or require encryption. See <a href="connections.html">Connection Management</a> for full details.</p> 
   <p>Once you've created a connection, you should login using a username and password with the <tt> 
     <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.Connection" api="Connection" kind="class">
       Connection.login(String username, String password) 
     </clt></tt> method. Once you've logged in, you can being chatting with other users by creating new <tt> 
     <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.Chat" api="Chat" kind="class">
       Chat 
     </clt></tt> or <tt>GroupChat</tt> objects. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="subsection"> 
   <p class="subheader">Working with the Roster</p> The roster lets you keep track of the availability (presence) of other users. Users can be organized into groups such as &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Co-workers&quot;, and then you discover whether each user is online or offline. 
   <p> Retrieve the roster using the <tt> 
     <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.Connection.getRoster" api="getRoster" kind="method">
       Connection.getRoster() 
     </clt></tt> method. The roster class allows you to find all the roster entries, the groups they belong to, and the current presence status of each entry. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="subsection"> 
   <p class="subheader"> Reading and Writing Packets </p> Each message to the XMPP server from a client is called a packet and is sent as XML. The 
   <tt>org.jivesoftware.smack.packet</tt> package contains classes that encapsulate the three different basic packet types allowed by XMPP (message, presence, and IQ). Classes such as 
   <tt>
    <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.Chat" api="Chat" kind="class">
     Chat
    </clt></tt> and 
   <tt>GroupChat</tt> provide higher-level constructs that manage creating and sending packets automatically, but you can also create and send packets directly. Below is a code example for changing your presence to let people know you're unavailable and &quot;out fishing&quot;: 
   <p> </p> 
   <div class="code"> 
    <pre>
<font color="gray"><i>// Create a new presence. Pass in false to indicate we're unavailable.</i></font>
Presence presence = new Presence(Presence.Type.unavailable);
presence.setStatus(<font color="green">&quot;Gone fishing&quot;</font>);
<font color="gray"><i>// Send the packet (assume we have a Connection instance called &quot;con&quot;).</i></font>
con.sendPacket(presence);
</pre> 
   </div> 
   <p> Smack provides two ways to read incoming packets: <tt> 
     <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.PacketListener" api="PacketListener" kind="class">
       PacketListener 
     </clt></tt>, and <tt> 
     <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.PacketCollector" api="PacketCollector" kind="class">
       PacketCollector 
     </clt></tt>. Both use <tt> 
     <clt fqn="org.jivesoftware.smack.filter.PacketFilter" api="PacketFilter" kind="class">
       PacketFilter 
     </clt></tt> instances to determine which packets should be processed. A packet listener is used for event style programming, while a packet collector has a result queue of packets that you can do polling and blocking operations on. So, a packet listener is useful when you want to take some action whenever a packet happens to come in, while a packet collector is useful when you want to wait for a specific packet to arrive. Packet collectors and listeners can be created using an Connection instance. </p>

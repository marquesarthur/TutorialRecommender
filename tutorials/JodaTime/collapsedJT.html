  <h2>Introduction<a name="Introduction"></a></h2> 
  <p> Joda Time is like an iceberg, 9/10ths of it is invisible to user-code. Many, perhaps most, applications will never need to see what's below the surface. This document provides an introduction to the Joda-Time API for the average user, not for the would-be API developer. </p> 
  <p> The bulk of the text is devoted to code snippets that display the most common usage scenarios in which the library classes are used. In particular, we cover the usage of the key <tt>DateTime</tt>, <tt>Interval</tt>, <tt>Duration</tt> and <tt>Period</tt> classes. </p> 
  <p> We finish with a look at the important topic of formatting and parsing and a few more advanced topics. </p>

   <h2>Instants<a name="Instants"></a></h2> 
   <p> The most frequently used concept in Joda-Time is that of the <i><tt>instant</tt></i>. An Instant is defined as <i>a moment in the datetime continuum specified as a number of milliseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00Z</i>. This definition of milliseconds is consistent with that of the JDK in <tt>Date</tt> or <tt>Calendar</tt>. Interoperating between the two APIs is thus simple. </p> 
   <p> Within Joda-Time an instant is represented by the <tt>ReadableInstant</tt> interface. The main implementation of this interface, and the class that the average API user needs to be most familiar with, is <tt>DateTime</tt>. <tt>DateTime</tt> is immutable - and once created the values do not change. Thus, this class can safely be passed around and used in multiple threads without synchronization. </p> 
   <p> The millisecond instant can be converted to any date time field using a <i>Chronology</i>. To assist with this, methods are provided on <tt>DateTime</tt> that act as getters for the most common date and time fields. </p> 
   <p> We discuss the chronology concept a litte further on in this overview. </p> 
   <p> A companion mutable class to <tt>DateTime</tt> is <tt>MutableDateTime</tt>. Objects of this class can be modified and are not thread-safe. </p>

   <p> For example, consider a period of 1 month. If you add this period to the 1st February (ISO) then you will get the 1st March. If you add the same period to the 1st March you will get the 1st April. But the duration added (in milliseconds) in these two cases is very different. </p>

   <p> <tt>Periods</tt> are implemented as a set of <tt>int</tt> fields. The standard set of fields in a period are years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds and millis.

   <h2>Chronology<a name="Chronology"></a></h2> 
   <p> The Joda-Time design is based around the <i>Chronology</i>. It is a calculation engine that supports the complex rules for a calendar system. It encapsulates the field objects, which are used on demand to split the absolute time instant into recognisable calendar fields like 'day-of-week'. It is effectively a pluggable calendar system. </p> 
   <p> The actual calculations of the chronology are split between the <tt>Chronology</tt> class itself and the field classes - <tt>DateTimeField</tt> and <tt>DurationField</tt>. Together, the subclasses of these three classes form the bulk of the code in the library. Most users will never need to use or refer directly to the subclasses. Instead, they will simply obtain the chronology and use it as a singleton, as follows: CODEID=6. Internally, all the chronology, field, etc. classes are maintained as singletons. Thus there is an initial setup cost when using Joda-Time, but after that only the main API instance classes (<tt>DateTime</tt>, <tt>Interval</tt>, <tt>Period</tt>, etc.) have creation and garbage collector costs. </p> 
   <p> Although the Chronology is key to the design, it is not key to using the API !! </p> 
   <p> For most applications, the Chronology can be ignored as it will default to the ISOChronology. This is suitable for most uses. You would change it if you need accurate dates before October 15, 1582, or whenever the Julian calendar ceased in the territory you're interested in). You'd also change it if you need a specific calendar like the Coptic calendar illustrated earlier. </p>

   <h2>Interface usage<a name="Interface_usage"></a></h2>

CODEID=13. In Joda-Time, the interfaces exist to allow 
   <i>interoperation</i> between similar date implementations, such as a mutable and immutable version of a class. As such, they only offer a subset of the methods of the concrete class.

   <h3>Construction<a name="Construction"></a></h3> 
   <p> A datetime object is created by using a <tt>DateTime</tt> constructor. The default constructor is used as follows CODEID=22 and creates a datetime object representing the current date and time in milliseconds as determined by the system clock. It is constructed using the ISO calendar in the default time zone. 
   <p> To create a datetime object representing a specific date and time, you may use an initialization string: CODEID=23. The initialization string must be in a format that is compatible with the ISO8601 standard. 
   <p> <tt>DateTime</tt> also provides <a href="apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTime.html#constructor_summary">other constructors</a> to create a specific date and time using a variety of standard fields. This also permits the use of any calendar and timezone. </p>

   <h3>JDK Interoperability<a name="JDK_Interoperability"></a></h3>

This is one half of the interoperability with the JDK. The other half of interoperability with JDK is provided by <tt>DateTime</tt> methods which return JDK objects. </p> 
   <p> Thus inter-conversion between Joda <tt>DateTime</tt> and JDK <tt>Date</tt> can be performed as follows CODEID=24. Similarly, for JDK <tt>Calendar</tt>: CODEID=25 and JDK <tt>GregorianCalendar</tt>: CODEID=26.

       <h3>Accessing fields<a name="Accessing_fields"></a></h3> 
       <p>The direct methods are fine for simple usage, but more flexibility can be achieved via the property/field mechanism. The day of week property is obtained by CODEID=35 which can be used to get richer information about the field, such as CODEID=36 which return short and long name strings (based on the current locale) of the day-of-week. Localized versions of these methods are also available, thus CODEID=37 can be used to return the day-of-week name string in French. 
       <p> Of course, the original integer value of the field is still accessible as CODEID=38. The property also provides access to other values associated with the field such as metadata on the minimum and maximum text size, leap status, related durations, etc. For a complete reference, see the 
       <a href="apidocs/org/joda/time/field/AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty.html">documentation</a> for the base class 
       <tt>AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty</tt> 
       <p> In practice, one would not actually create the intermediate <tt>pDoW</tt> variable. The code is easier to read if the methods are called on anonymous intermediate objects. Thus, for example, CODEID=39 would be written instead of the more indirect code presented earlier. 
       <p> Note: For the single case of getting the numerical value of a field, we recommend using the get method on the main <tt>DateTime</tt> object as it is more efficient. CODEID=40.

An Instant is defined as a moment in the datetime continuum specified as a number of milliseconds from 1970-01-01T00:00Z. This definition of milliseconds is consistent with that of the JDK in CLT or CLT .
Within Joda-Time an instant is represented by the CLT interface.
The main implementation of this interface, and the class that the average API user needs to be most familiar with, is CLT .
The millisecond instant can be converted to any date time field using a CLT .
To assist with this, methods are provided on CLT that act as getters for the most common date and time fields.
A companion mutable class to CLT is CLT .
Other implementations of CLT include CLT and CLT . &quot; &quot;

The main API of CLT has been kept small, limited to just get methods for each calendar field.
So, for instance, the 'day-of-year' calendar field would be retrieved by calling the CLT method.

An CLT  in Joda-Time represents an interval of time from one instant to another instant.
CLT are implemented as half-open, which is to say that the start instant is inclusive but the end instant is exclusive.
Two implementations are provided, CLT and CLT , both are specializations of CLT . &quot; &quot;

A CLT  in Joda-Time represents a duration of time measured in milliseconds.
CLT are a very simple concept, and the implementation is also simple.
CLT can be added to an instant, or to either end of an interval to change those objects.
In datetime maths you could say:   instant + duration = instant   Currently, there is only one implementation of the CLT interface: CLT . &quot; &quot;

A CLT  in Joda-Time represents a period of time defined in terms of fields, for example, 3 years 5 months 2 days and 7 hours.
CLT are implemented as a set of CLT fields.
The CLT class allows this set of fields to be restricted, for example to elimate weeks.
CLT are not associated with either a chronology or a time zone.

The actual calculations of the chronology are split between the CLT class itself and the field classes - CLT and CLT .
Thus there is an initial setup cost when using Joda-Time, but after that only the main API instance classes (CLT , CLT , CLT , etc.) have creation and garbage collector costs.
For most applications, the Chronology can be ignored as it will default to the CLT .

Although the CLT is key to the design, it is not key to using the API !!

The most important is CLT which currently has 4 implementations.
Other significant interfaces include CLT and CLT .
When working with a Collections interface, such as CLT or CLT you will normally hold your variable as a type of CLT or CLT , only referencing the concrete class when you create the object.

A datetime object is created by using a CLT constructor.
CLT also provides other constructors to create a specific date and time using a variety of standard fields.
The CLT class has a constructor which takes an CLT as input.
In particular this constructor can be passed a JDK CLT , JDK CLT or JDK CLT (It also accepts an ISO8601 formatted String, or CLT object representing milliseconds).
The other half of interoperability with JDK is provided by CLT methods which return JDK objects.
Thus inter-conversion between Joda CLT and JDK CLT can be performed as follows.
toDate(), // from JDK to Joda dt = new DateTime(jdkDate),   Similarly, for JDK CLT :   // from Joda to JDK DateTime dt = new DateTime(), Calendar jdkCal = dt.
CHINESE), // from JDK to Joda dt = new DateTime(jdkCal),   and JDK CLT :   // from Joda to JDK DateTime dt = new DateTime(), GregorianCalendar jdkGCal = dt.
The separation of the calculation of calendar fields (CLT ) from the representation of the calendar instant (CLT ) makes for a powerful and flexible API.
The connection between the two is maintained by the property (CLT ) which provides access to the field.
For instance, the direct way to get the day of week for a particular CLT , involves calling the method.
getDayOfWeek(),   where CLT can take the values (from class CLT ).

For a complete reference, see the documentation for the base class CLT In practice, one would not actually create the intermediate CLT variable.
Note: For the single case of getting the numerical value of a field, we recommend using the get method on the main CLT object as it is more efficient.
The CLT implementation provides a complete list of standard calendar fields:   dt.
getDayOfWeek(),   Each of these also has a corresponding property method, which returns a CLT binding to the appropriate field, such as CLT or CLT .

Thus to compute the hours, minutes and seconds of the instant represented by a CLT , we would write.
CLT objects have value semantics, and cannot be modified after construction (they are immutable).
To return to our prior example, if we wish to modify the CLT object by changing its day-of-week field to Monday we can do so by using the CLT method of the property:   DateTime result = dt.
MONDAY),   Note: If the CLT object is already set to Monday then the same object will be returned.
To add to a date you could use the CLT method.

Another means of accomplishing similar calculations is to use methods on the CLT object itself.
Thus we could add 3 days to CLT directly as follows:   DateTime result = dt.
toDateTime(),   CLT has a number of methods, including standard setters, for directly modifying the datetime. &quot; &quot;
CLT comes with support for a couple of common timezone calculations.
forID(&quot;,Europe/London&quot;,)),   where CLT returns the timezone value for London.
The resulting value CLT has the same absolute millisecond time, but a different set of field values.
forID(&quot;,Europe/London&quot;,)),   A set of all TimeZone ID strings (such as &quot;,Europe/London&quot;,) may be obtained by calling CLT .

All printing and parsing is performed using a CLT object.
Given such an object CLT , parsing is performed as follows.
parseDateTime(strInputDateTime),   Thus a CLT object is returned from the parse method of the formatter.
Support for standard formats based on ISO8601 is provided by the CLT class.
For example, if you wanted to use the ISO standard format for datetime, which is CLT , you would initialize CLT as.
dateTime(),   You would then use CLT as described above, to read or write datetime objects in this format. &quot; &quot;
If you need a custom formatter which can be described in terms of a format pattern, you can use the factory method provided by the CLT class.
Thus to get a formatter for a 4 digit year, 2 digit month and 2 digit day of month, i.e. a format of CLT you would do.
You may need to print or parse in a particular CLT .
This is achieved by calling the CLT method on a formatter, which returns another formatter based on the original.
GERMAN),   Formatters are immutable, so the original is not altered by the CLT method. &quot; &quot;

The final CLT method creates the actual formatter that will be used to print/parse.
Since the interpretation of a two digit year is ambiguous, the CLT takes an extra parameter that defines the 100 year range of the two digits, by specifying the mid point of the range.

To simplify the access to the formatter architecture, methods have been provided on the datetime classes such as CLT .
Result CLT is the standard ISO8601 string for the DateTime.
Result CLT will output using the pattern 'dd:MM:yy' (note that patterns are cached internally).
Result CLT will output using the pattern 'EEE' in French.
Result CLT will output using the specified formatter, and is thus the same as CLT . &quot; &quot;
All methods that get the current time are indirected via CLT .
The constructors on each major concrete class in the API take an CLT as a parameter.
For example, the converters can convert a JDK CLT object to a CLT .
See CLT for details. &quot;
